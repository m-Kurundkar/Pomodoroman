# Pomodoroman
Hello! Pomodoroman is a mini Pomodoro timer web application. I wanted to make something I would use, and this is the improved version for everyone.
Features: 
  * Timer modes: Choose between 25min work/5min break, 50/10 or 90/30.
  * Companion widgets to add a little life to your work sessions by talking to you (or scolding you!)
    (Don't try to find all their dialogue bubbles, it will take too long.)
  * Music/Ambient sound choice: "Eldrum: Ryke Valley", "Rain", "Waves" and "Medieval"!

How to use:
